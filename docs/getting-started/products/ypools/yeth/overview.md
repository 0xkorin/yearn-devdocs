yETH is a user-governed liquidity pool token consisting of various Ethereum Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSTs).

The yETH protocol is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) for LSTs. Each LST in the yETH pool is priced according to the amount of [beacon chain](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/beacon-chain/) ETH it represents. This lets users deposit their LSTs into the pool and receive yETH tokens pegged 1:1 with beacon chain ETH. Users can also stake their yETH tokens to mint st-yETH, accrue yield, and participate in yETH governance.

This AMM model, combined with the governance and incentive mechanisms of the yETH protocol, aims to provide an optimal risk-adjusted yield for ETH staking by dynamically adjusting the weights of the LSTs in the pool. It also offers users flexibility with single-sided deposits and withdrawals, and maintains the pool's balance and diversification through a weight management system.

The yETH protocol is governed by its users who can vote to adjust the weights of the LSTs in the pool, helping to maximize yield and mitigate risks associated with individual LSTs.

All yields generated by yETH go to Staked yETH (st-yETH) holders, making yETH an ideal token for Liquidity Providing in stableswap pools like those on Curve. To acquire yETH, users can mint yETH by depositing LSTs or swap against the yETH/ETH Curve pool.

## Staked yETH (st-yETH)

Users stake their yETH to mint st-yETH, accrue yield, and later unstake st-yETH to receive yETH back according to their earnings. Stakers receive all yield and slashings from the beacon chain (Ethereum proof-of-stake validators) and earn incentives if they participate and vote in yETH governance.

By bundling LSTs, st-yETH aims to generate the best risk-adjusted yield from ETH staking. Through protocol governance, st-yETH users can readjust pool weights to maximize yield while mitigating catastrophic scenarios where one or several LSTs in the yETH composition suffer adverse events like de-pegging or security incidents.
